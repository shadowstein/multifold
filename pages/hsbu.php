            <h4>AdRem NetCrunch</h4>
              <p>NetCrunch enables IT teams to eliminate performance and technology
              inefficiencies associated with the reactive and segmented network management
              approaches. NetCrunch users can stay ahead of disruptions, being able to detect
              and resolve problems faster, and allocate resources more effectively. On a higher
              organizational level, this allows IT shops to transition to a preventative, proactive,
              and unified operations model.
              </p>
              <p>NetCrunch comes in two editions: Premium and Premium XE. NetCrunch Premium
              is recommended for small networks with a couple of hundred nodes. NetCrunch
              Premium XE meets the increasing demand for an enterprise network monitoring.
              For such networks, the monitoring performance and scalability are critical areas in
              network management. The Premium XE edition is designed to run on a dedicated
              machine with Windows Server. The XE edition monitors the availability of larger
              networks and enables an administrator to extensively monitor the performance of
              servers as well as to handle a larger number of SNMP devices. In this edition, the
              resource usage on the dedicated machine is optimized to ensure that all nodes
              and services are being monitored within the requested time.

              <p>iQ License Plate Recognition<br>
              IQ-LPD and IQ-LPR allow highly accurate License Plate Detection and
              Recognition respectively. The IQ-LPD system can detect and record plates
              for manual review. The more comprehensive IQ-LPR system can detect and
              automatically read the alpha numeric characters in any images. With the
              ability to recognize color it can detect plates from almost any country.
              </p>

              <p>IQ-LPD will recognize the presence of a vehicle when it approaches and
              detect the plate. IQ-LPR will further read the plate and check a database for
              the required action such as trigger a control relay to open a gate.

              same camera.

              <p>iQ Hawk<br>
              The IQ-Hawk is the first commercially robust engine that allows for detection
              and identification of multiple objects or people within a single scene
              simultaneously.

              <p>iQ Driver-Match<br>
              IQ Driver-Match is a unique product offering with both License Plate and Driver
              Identification. This is particularly useful in car parks to prevent the theft of
              vehicles. The vehicle's number plate is recognized and the driver is identified using
              iOm niscient's sophisticated Facial Recognition system. The system matches the License
              Plate with the driver and ensures that only he or one of his predefiend nominees is
              driving the vehicle.
              </p>

              <p>The system is unique in that the facial recognition does not require a
              controlled environment. It can operate with low resolution cameras and
              variable facial angles.

              <p>SmartCatch Video Intrusion Detection - Rather than using separately deployed
              sensors, SmartCatch automatically monitors the video feeds coming from the
              CCTV system, recognizes suspicious activity, and reports it to your guards.
              SmartCatch dramatically lowers the cost of perimeter intrusion detection.
              Because it utilizes the CCTV cameras you need anyway, SmartCatch costs 50%
              less than fence sensors on an installed basis. And while it provides the same sort
              of volumetric detection as buried cable systems, SmartCatch costs 70-80% less.
              </p>
              
              <p>SmartCatch detects threats sooner than traditional sensors. Rather than waiting
               until an attack occurs, SmartCatch watches outside the perimeter for threats such
               as loiterers, approaching intruders and stopped vehicles. Unlike traditional
               sensors, SmartCatch instantly shows you a video clip of the cause of every alarm.
               There's no need for guards to select cameras and search video. They can assess
               each alert in seconds to determine the appropriate response. And if you have PTZ
               cameras, SmartCatch automatically points them at the intruder and tracks the
               intruder's movements through your facility.
